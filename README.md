# HTML and CSS only application
**This is a web homepage made with only HTML and CSS; with fully responsivity!**

The project can be executed with the SASS Compiler and Live Server extensions for VSCode.

- You can just left-click on the index.html and click on "Open with Live Server"; the extension will open automatically the server on port that it will run the application. Each time that you save the project, it will reload the browser page with the new modifications.

- The navbar on click integration was made with a bit of JavaScript.
